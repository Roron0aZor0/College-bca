Project Title:
"E-Commerce Website for Educational Institute 'I Tech'"
1. Introduction:
This project involves the development of an eCommerce website for "I Tech," an educational institute that offers programs and services in teaching programming languages and essential computer skills. In the digital age, access to high-quality, flexible education is more important than ever, and this website will provide an efficient platform for students to explore and purchase various courses, enroll in programs, and access educational resources.
2. Objectives:
•	To create a responsive eCommerce platform for I Tech to sell its educational programs and services.
•	To implement a user-friendly course catalog where users can browse, filter, and search for programming and computer skills courses.
•	To develop an integrated and secure payment gateway for easy online transactions.
•	To provide an admin panel for managing courses, student enrollments, and order details.
•	To allow students to create accounts, enroll in courses, and access purchased materials.
3. Scope:
The eCommerce website will allow users to view and purchase educational programs, both pre-recorded and live sessions. Users can create accounts to track their enrollments and progress. The platform will also feature a secure payment system to process transactions. The admin panel will allow the management of course listings, orders, and user enrollments. Advanced features such as personalized course recommendations or live chat support are outside the scope of this project due to time constraints.

5.	Payment Module: Integration with a third-party payment gateway (e.g., paytm, razzorpay)
6.	Search and Filter Module: Allows users to search and filter courses by programming language, skill level, and course format (live/recorded).
5. Technology Stack:
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js for dynamic content)
•	Backend: Node.js with Express or PHP (Laravel) for handling business logic and data.
•	Database: MySQL or MongoDB for storing course data, user information, and transactions.
•	Payment Gateway: Razorpay or Paytm for processing course purchases.

6. Expected Outcome:
The result of this project will be a fully functional eCommerce website for "I Tech." The platform will allow users to browse through a catalog of courses, add courses to the cart, and make secure payments. It will also feature an admin panel for managing courses and orders. Students will be able to create accounts, view purchased courses, and track their progress.
