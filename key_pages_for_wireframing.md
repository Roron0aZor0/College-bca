Design Choices for "I tech"
1. Color Scheme
Your color scheme should align with the professional and educational focus of "I tech." Since you’re teaching programming and computer skills, clean and modern colors will work well.

Primary Color: Blue is often associated with trust and knowledge, making it a great primary color.
Example shades: #1E90FF (Dodger Blue), #00509E (Strong Blue).
Secondary Color: You can pair blue with a contrasting color like orange or green to make CTA buttons stand out.
Example shades: #FF9505 (Bright Orange), #00BFA6 (Teal Green).
Neutral Colors: Use neutral tones like white, light gray, and dark gray for backgrounds and text.
Example shades: #FFFFFF (White), #F0F0F0 (Light Gray), #2C2C2C (Dark Gray).
2. Typography
Choose a modern, readable font for your website, especially since you’re targeting a tech-savvy audience.

Heading Font: Use a bold, sans-serif font for headings to give the website a modern and clean look.
Example: Poppins, Montserrat, or Roboto.
Body Font: Use a simple, clean font for the main text to ensure readability.
Example: Open Sans, Lato, or Nunito.
Font Sizes:
Headings (H1: 32px, H2: 24px).
Body text (16px–18px).
Button text (14px–16px).
3. Icons and Images
Use flat icons for things like search buttons, cart icons, and account icons. Websites like FontAwesome or Material Icons offer plenty of choices.
For images (course thumbnails, hero sections), ensure high quality and consistency in size. Use stock photos related to tech education or images of people working on laptops, writing code, etc.
4. Button Design
Primary Buttons (e.g., “Enroll Now” or “Add to Cart”) should use your secondary color (orange or teal) to stand out.
Example: Use a bright orange button (#FF9505) with white text and rounded corners.
Hover Effects: Add hover effects like a slight change in button color or shadow to make it interactive.
5. Responsiveness
Mobile First: Design with mobile in mind. Start by creating a layout that works on smaller screens, then adapt for larger screens.
Menu: Use a hamburger menu for mobile view to save space.
Grid Layout: Ensure your grid layouts (e.g., course catalog) stack vertically on smaller screens for better readability.
